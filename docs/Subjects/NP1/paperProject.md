# Group paper work

Together with your lab group, you need to prepare a paper work, as explained in
the slides of the first class [Presentation](slides/Presentation.pdf).

It is a documentation work in which you are requested to explore an document
yourself on one of the networking technologies used for or focused on IoT
systems. The technologies proposed are listed bellow. You are requested to focus
the study on its use in your local area or China, however you can expand it to
Asia or the whole world if you feel like doing it (not required).

In both cases you should study not only the technical aspects of the technology,
you should also include known use cases (in the case of choosing one of the
technologies proposed below), expected growth of the technology, direct
competitors and potential future market share.

## List of networking technologies you can consider

The networking technologies for the paper work shall not overlap between groups,
you should request one of the topics sending a mail to the professor
(tenllado@ucm.es), who will confirm if you can choose the topic or if it has
been already chosen by other group.

The topics are:

- 5G
- Narrow Band IoT (NBIoT)
- LoRa
- SigFox
- Zigbee
- Thread and Open Thread
- DotDot and Thread
- Practical use case study of 6LoWPAN networks
- Network Technologies for Smart Buildings
- Network Technologies for Industry 4.0
- Wifi Mesh technologies
- Network Technologies for Domotics (home automation)
- Practical use case of any of the studed technologies

## Deadline
Originally 8th April.

## Delivering the project
Once finished, please send me an email (to tenllado@ucm.es)
