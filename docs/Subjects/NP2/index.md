# Networks and Protocols 2

## General information

This subject will cover different topics about application-level
communication APIs, standard and interfaces, with special emphasis
on Internet of Things inter-communication. Specifically, we will
cover both Linux and 
[ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html) 
programming on the ESP32, to fulfill the following specific goals:

* Get a global overview of the necessities and particularities of
IoT from the application communication perspective.
* Advocate for open standards for IoT communication.
* Introduce the concept of Smart Object, and study how it can be
ported to different APIs and languages.
* Introduce different techniques for information representation.
* Study a number of IoT frameworks and stream processing platforms.
