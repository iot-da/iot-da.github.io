# Individual paper work

You need to prepare a paper work, as explained in
the slides of the first class [Presentation](slides/Presentation.pdf).

It is a documentation work in which you are requested to explore a set of documents
yourself on one of the application-level protocols, technologies and platforms 
used for or focused on IoT systems. 
The technologies proposed are listed bellow. You are requested to focus
the study on its use in your local area or China, however you can expand it to
Asia or the whole world if you feel like doing it (not required).

In both cases you should study not only the technical aspects of the technology,
you should also include known use cases (in the case of choosing one of the
technologies proposed below), expected growth of the technology, direct
competitors and potential future market share. Practical implementations, code
snippets, or even protoype codes are also welcome.

## List of technologies you can consider

You should request one of the topics sending a mail to the professor
(figual@ucm.es) before **March 1st**, who will confirm if you can choose 
the topic.

The topics are:

- Advanced MQTT
- Advanced CoAP
- LWM2M and Smart Objects
- Websockets
- Digital twins
- Advanced visualization services and dashboards
- The Eclipse IoT project
- Advanced JSON and CBOR 
- Amazon Web Services for IoT
- Microsoft Azure for IoT
- Google services for IoT
- Alibaba IoT
- OTA (Over the Air) updates
- Edge Computing
- A comparative study of IoT platforms
- Practical use cases of any of the studied technologies

## Deadline
Originally 8th April.

## Delivering the project
Once finished, please send me an email (to **figual@ucm.es**)
