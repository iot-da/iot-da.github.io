# Week1: Introduction

## Introduction 
* Students can find two pdf file with the slides corresponding to Introduction:
    1. A general [Introduction](slides/Week1_Intro.pdf) of Edge Computing with the motivation and evolution of IoT tecnology
    2. Moreover, in the [Artificial Inteligence](slides/Week1_AI_Edge.pdf) slides, a brief introduction to artificial intelligence, as well as the difference between machine learning and deep-learning will be deepened. Finally, in this group of slides, the trend in the use of hardware systems in edge computing where the use of AI is widespread will be addressed to present the Jetson-Nano device on which most of the subject will be carried out.

## Jetson-Nano Setup 
* Students will have a Jetson Nano device to perform the tasks related with the subject. This developer kit should be configured properly, a microSD image can be downloaded from the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SOixGDA72zehrklfempaNOAPTBnbEeFs?usp=sharing). This image can be [flashed into an SD card](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) to dispose the Jetson-Nano running properly. However, the following transparencies available sumarized the process:
    1. [Installation guide](slides/Week1_JetsonNano_setup.pdf) and manual setup of the system image
    2. A tutorial is also available to [configure the Raspberry-Pi camera](setup_Jetson-Nano.md)
