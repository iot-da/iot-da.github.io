# IoT Node Architecture

## General information

This subject will cover several topics regarding embedded system programmings. Specifically, we will learn to develop IoT projects using [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html), a framework built onto [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/).  Some specific goals if this subject are:

* Get a global view of a safe application  development cycle.
* Meet the main components of an IoT device
* Learn basic components of Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
* Work with sensors and learn the most common interfaces
