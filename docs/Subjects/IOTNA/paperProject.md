# Personal paper project

As I explained the first day of course (and you can find in the provided slides), *you need to develop a personal (individual) paper project*. Here I copy the guidelines that you can also find in the [SoC slides](slides/soc.pdf)

## Deadline 
Originally 20th Dec. *EXTENDED deadline to 10th January 2022.*


## Project description

First, you need to imagine a specific scenario where IoT could help. Think on a *small* application of any typical IoT use case (smart cities, home automation, eHealth, smart agriculture...).

Then you need to perform a theoretical study about the required hardware components, including:

- Which node would you buy?  Which SoC? Which prototype board for the initial tests?  Include several candidates in your study and motivate why you choose one of them
- Which sensors do you require? You need to specify which kind of sensor and also which exact model
- How much computation would you need to perform in the node?
- Which RTOS (Real Time Operating System)? Which IDE to develop?
- Which are the communication requirements? (how often do you communicate data, how much data...)
- Where will be energy spent? How are you powering the system?
- Think about the final packaging of the system (a plastic box built with a 3D printer? Any specific material?)
- Include the (approximate) total budget. Include links to online shops where you could buy the material

IMPORTANTE: there is NO code to be develop. Only paper work.

##Â Work extension

You need to motivate each decision (why do you choose a specific SoC and not another one?) but I do not expect the work to be extra-long. Definitely *no more than 10 pages*.

## Delivering the project
Once finished, please send me an email (to jigomez@ucm.es)
