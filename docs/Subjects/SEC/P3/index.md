# Laboratory 3. Smart Socket Pentest

During this lab you are going to perform a PenTest of a real device, the Smartsocket Orvibo S30C. This work will be done in pairs. For this you can use the groups available in IOTNA *Final programming project* ([link](https://iot-da.github.io/Subjects/IOTNA/P7/)). 

!!! danger "Remember that this practice represents a total of 30% of the grade. You can send me the corresponding memory until June 3 ([recas@ucm.es](mailto:recas@ucm.es))."

### Material

App that should be used to control the Smart Plug: [Home Mate Apk](HomeMate.apk) 

In case you are not able to record an On/Off sequence, use these files (**only for synchronous class, not valid for Pentest Project**):

* Group 1 file: 
    * [Trace1.pcapng](Trace1.pcapng) 
* Group 2 file: 
    * [Trace2.pcapng](Trace2.pcapng) 
* Group 3 file: 
    * [Trace3.pcapng](Trace3.pcapng) 
* Group 4 file: 
    * [Trace4.pcapng](Trace4.pcapng) 
* Group 5 file: 
    * [Trace5.pcapng](Trace5.pcapng) 
* Group 6 file: 
    * [Trace6.pcapng](Trace6.pcapng) 

**Python script for AES-ECB description:**
