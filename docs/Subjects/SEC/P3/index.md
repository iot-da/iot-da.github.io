# Laboratory 3. IP Smart Socket Pentest

During this lab you are going to perform a PenTest of a real device, the Smartsocket Orvibo S30C. This work will be done in pairs. For this you can use the groups available in IOTNA *Final programming project* ([link](https://iot-da.github.io/Subjects/IOTNA/P7/)). 

!!! danger "Remember that this practice represents a total of 30% of the grade. You can send me the corresponding memory until May 3 ([recas@ucm.es](mailto:recas@ucm.es))."
