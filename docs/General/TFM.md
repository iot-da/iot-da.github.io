## Proposals

### Proposal 1

* Title: *Relation between air pollution, weather and traffic*
* Description:

The goal is to predict the pollution in a particular point of a city for the next few hours. The prediction will take as input from the data collected by sensors of air pollution and number of vehicles. We will train different models and evaluate the results to choose the best predictions in each case. The project includes:
  - Basic data management to prepare the data
  - Basic statistics to understand the data and detect outliers
  - Clustering for selecting days with similar pollution/traffic conditions
  - Feature selection
  - Hiperparameter tunning
  - Model Selection

* Requirements: good programming skills.
* Professor: Rafael Caballero Roldán.
* Available slots: 6

### Proposal 2

* Title: Machine Learning Ensamble Methods
* Description:

The ensemble Methods combine several "weak learners" to build a more efficient method. The main goal is to implement in Spark the three main Methods (bagging, stacking and Boosting). On particular the project will include:
  - A complete description of the tecniques
  - A Spark function implementing then
  - A benchmark using some datasets of the course to compare their efficiency

* Requirements: good programming skills.
* Professor: Rafael Caballero Roldán.
* Available slots: 6

### Proposal 3

* Title: *IoT devices or services for well-being*

* Description:

Well-being is usually desired by most people, and smart watches and smart bands are growing in
popularity for such purpose. However, other IoT devices and services can help users to provide
accurate perspectives of certain well-being aspects in order to provide personalized advices for
increasing the well-being. For example, smart beds can help you in tracking you sleeping, door
sensors could measure the time spent in outdoor activities or the times you eat meals at home. All
this information related with emotional information could feed an intelligent system to output the
right advices for increasing the well-being. This work could be conducted from either (1) a research
perspective being relevant the analysis of existing works in this topic and the proposal of novel ideas,
or (2) from a technical perspective addressing to program some intelligent system for providing well-
being advices based on information from IoT devices.

### Proposal 4

* Title: *IoT devices or services for healthcare*
* Description:

Healthcare is benefiting from the growing of IoT. For instance, smart homes could track the progress
of certain symptoms. Smart IoT dispensers can help patients in reminding their medication to avoid
both missing it and forgetting whether certain medication has been taken. This work could be
conducted from either (1) a research perspective being relevant the analysis of existing works in this
topic and the proposal of novel ideas, or (2) from a technical perspective addressing to prototype a
certain IoT device or service and program the necessary software for providing a system that could
help in some aspect of healthcare.
